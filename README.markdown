# 37emacs

Emacs Lisp client libraries for various 37signals APIs.

## backpack.el

A client library for the Backpack API.

## highrise.el

A client library for the Highrise API. Currently only supports reading
data from Highrise.

Integrates with EUDC, so you can tab-complete Highrise contacts in
mail-mode and message-mode.

## rest-api.el

This is where I'm collecting little utilities that come in handy when
coding to REST APIs in Emacs Lisp.
